# cpractice

I decided to practice my skills in C in my free time using codewars.com. All of these functions come from prompts and each has passed the tests on their website. Each function comes with a .c file containing the funtion and a .txt file containing the instructions. I have separated them into difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
